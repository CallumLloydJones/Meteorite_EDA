## Introduction
This notebook is an exploratory analysis of meteorite landings from NASAs available datasets.

### Objectives
- Scope, prepare, analyse, and create a machine learning model to solve a question.
- Provide a visual representation of the data.

## Data Science Methodology

### Project Description
Geographical plots, count plots, pie charts, and histograms have been used to clearly visualise trends in the dataset. 

### Data Science Methods
- Data Aquisition 
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualisation

## Conclusions
The dataset did not contain a large number of features (columns) to explore but it still provides a good exercise in visualisation. The data clearly has a sampling bias geometrically. All features were explored and visualised with appropriate type of plots. This was also an exercise in using API requests and cleaning data although the data was pretty clean to begin.
